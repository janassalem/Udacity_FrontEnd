# Personal Tech Blog

This is a **Personal Blog Website** designed to showcase various topics in technology, sustainability, and business innovation. It follows a modern structure, custom design, and responsive layout while separating content from styling. The project meets the rubric for structure, design, layout, responsiveness, and quality, ensuring a clean and professional user experience.

## Features

- **Custom Design & Layout**: Fully customized design with unique styling for headers, paragraphs, buttons, and cards.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using Flexbox and Grid, ensuring usability across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Blog Post Pages**: Each article has a dedicated post page with detailed content and related articles section.

- **Semantic HTML**: The website uses semantic HTML5 elements for enhanced accessibility and SEO.
- **Optimized Images**: Images are optimized for faster loading times without compromising quality.
- **Well-structured Directories**: Files are neatly organized into directories for easy maintenance.

## Rubric Compliance

### 1. **Structure**
- **CSS Separated from HTML**: No inline styles are used. All styling is handled via external CSS files.
- **CSS Imports**: The main `style.css` imports 3 separate files for typography, layout, and design.
- **Directories**:
  - `index.html` is in the root directory.
  - Static assets (images, CSS) are stored in a folder called `assets/` for clear separation.

### 2. **Design**
- **Custom Typography**: Includes at least 3 unique properties (bold, italic, underline) for headers, paragraphs, and links.
- **Colors**: The project uses a palette of at least 3 colors for background, text, and accent colors.
- **Components**: Blog homepage, cards, buttons, images, and captions are styled as separate components.
- **Patterns**: The homepage follows a consistent pattern for Blog Post Cards, Image captions, and Related Articles.

### 3. **Layout**
- **Flexbox and Grid**: The website uses **Flexbox** for the card layout on the blog homepage and **CSS Grid** for post page layouts.
- **Responsiveness**: Pages are mobile-friendly and pass the Chrome DevTools simulation for multi-device design.

### 4. **Quality**
- **Valid HTML5**: Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` are used throughout the codebase.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Follows best practices for indentation, spacing, and quotation marks. CSS is clean, uses meaningful class names, and is separated by functionality.

## Pages

- **Home Page (`index.html`)**: Displays a set of featured articles with links to individual posts.
- **Post Pages**:
  - **Health Tech**: "The Rise of AI in Healthcare"
  - **Eco-friendly Gadgets**: "Eco-friendly Gadgets You Need"
  - **Future of Business**: "Future of Business: Tech-Driven Growth"
- **Related Articles**: Each post page has a section linking to 2 or 3 other articles.
