            <p>The technology landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, and 2024 is set to witness some of the most exciting developments yet. From artificial intelligence to sustainable tech, here are the five key innovations that will shape our future.</p>

            <h2>1. Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p>Quantum computing is no longer a distant dream. With major companies like IBM and Google making breakthroughs in quantum technology, 2024 could see quantum computers solving complex problems that were previously unsolvable with classical computers.</p>

            <h2>2. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</h2>
            <p>AI's role in healthcare is growing rapidly, with advancements in diagnostics, personalized treatments, and even robotic surgeries. In 2024, we can expect AI to play an even more significant role in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.</p>

            <h2>3. 5G Expansion and IoT</h2>
            <p>The expansion of 5G networks will continue to fuel the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling faster, more reliable connections between smart devices. From smart cities to autonomous vehicles, the possibilities are endless.</p>

            <h2>4. Biodegradable Electronics</h2>
            <p>Sustainability is becoming a core focus in tech innovation. Biodegradable electronics, which decompose naturally after their useful life, are set to reduce electronic waste and contribute to a greener future.</p>

            <h2>5. Augmented Reality (AR) in Everyday Life</h2>
            <p>AR technology is moving beyond gaming and entertainment. In 2024, we will see AR integrated into more practical applications, from virtual home tours to immersive educational experiences.</p>
